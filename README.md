**magyarkuti/magyarkuti** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Linear Algebra book and preparing for the fall semester.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Github pages, because I am tending to move my BCE website to a more private place.
- âš¡ The very last project I finished is https://magyarkuti.github.io/corvinusmetropolis. It is a LaTeX presentation template for my students and friends.
